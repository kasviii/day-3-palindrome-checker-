Palindrome Checker

# What It Does:

- Takes any word or phrase as input.
- Checks if it's a palindrome (reads the same backward and forward).
- Tells you whether it's a palindrome or not.

# How to Use It:

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the code file in your preferred programming environment.
3. Find the section where you can enter input (usually near the bottom).
4. Type in the word or phrase you want to check.
5. Run the code!
6. The output will tell you if it's a palindrome or not.

# Examples:

- Palindromes: "racecar", "noon", "madam", "tacocat"
- Not palindromes: "hello", "apple", "computer", "I love palindromes"
- Punctuation and spaces are ignored,: so "race car" is still a palindrome.
- Case (uppercase or lowercase) doesn't matter,: so "Noon" and "NOON" are both palindromes.
